How can we extend civic tech to civic organizations outside community?</p><p>In South Korea. most of civic organizations(NPO, NGO, and the media) are interested in data and data journalism, but they don’t have capacity to treat the data and data journalism. Event they don’t have any developers to maintain their own website. Because of that, after they constructed huge and valuable data to make stories for years, the data has been hidden somewhere on their PCs in not-machine-readable formats.</p><p>From this year, we’re developing a Data Specialists Working Group composed of civic hackers; technitians, designers, and data experts. This group will be in partnerships with NPO, NGO, and the media for data journalism projects. CodeNamu civic technitians and our partners composed of journalists and activits will make synergy to make those data open and to make various data journalism projects between CodeNamu’s civic tech and partners’ insight or messages. We hope that we’re going to introduce and discuss about the way to extend civic tech to outside civic tech community.</p>"

We created a formula which attracts cities to open up their data, engage citizens and make sure that data is used. And most importantly by introducing open data policies in Poland we make the change systemic.</p><p>Openness it is not only about publishing information. It’s essential part of building engagement in modern society. But we – citizens – need and often demand something more. We are ready to take responsibility for the place we live and work. We do care about the quality of the life we live in our cities. We need to be treated as partner by our government.</p><p>At first Personal Democracy Forum in Poland in 2013, Ellen Miller from Sunlight Fundation said that \"government is as strong as citizens informed\". Government can publish information, make it available, machine readable and up-to-date, but it will not encourage much more people to check them.</p><p>Can we do anything more to engage people in city life, to show them advantages of being active? How new technologies are moving us closer to participation? Did new applications can connect (or disconnect) citizens? Is it possible to empower citizens and allow them to manage our cities (not only from time to time, but daily)? How – by using technology – citizen can gather around idea, support it and make it happen?</p><p>And I can show examples of such process in Poland (Central Eastern Europe).</p>"

I'm going to share a story about a much longer game, where the payoff is just starting to happen now, five years later.</p><p>This will be a story of how organizations around the world built a software stack for legislative monitoring. It starts with a vision shared in Warsaw in 2011. In 2012, work on a standard data interchange format begins, which will tie the stack together. Two organizations start authoring backend data management tools in 2013 using this format. In 2014, the first user-facing tools appear at the top of this stack. And in 2015, governments begin adopting the data standard, as more user-facing tools spread.</p><p>This journey will visit many organizations and projects around the world, from mySociety to OpenAustralia to Sunlight, and from PopIt to Councilmatic to Represent, among others. We're five years into this journey, and there's still more ground to cover for at least as many more years before the basic problems in legislative monitoring that we're solving can be taken for granted.</p><p>This talk ties into the fork-merge theme. Legislative monitoring generally involves forking the official website, which requires scraping data to reproduce the information. Through government adoption of data standards like Popolo, we can eliminate these scrapers, and merge good data publication practices into government.</p>"

            "abstract": "<p>From the point of view of urban governance, Nepal’s towns and cities have expanded rapidly. The Kathmandu Valley has grown especially rapidly – from a population of about 1.6 million in 2001 to a population of about 2.5 million in 2011. This unexpected and unplanned growth has proven a challenge to many aspects of city life. The systems by which residents communicate, organize themselves, and negotiate with each other and the state has altered. When the intention is to radically reform the system, large amounts of money and manpower must be gathered. At the same time, there are few initiatives as well who take the opposite approach. New belief is that limited resources and focus also be sufficient in order to begin to dent the system as much as possible on basis of collaborations and crowdsourcing even though there are no single and known solutions to the complex issues of urban governance and no guarantee that any given intervention will succeed.</p><p>GalliGalli is an initiative based in Kathmandu which gathers, packages, and disseminates information using new technologies for the civilians to make their lives easier by providing information on processes – formal and informal – for accessing government services. GalliGalli works both on-the-ground and online. GalliGalli’s core focus is to use open source approach to enable people to take part in social change by facilitating mass participation. This paper would like to explain how these processes and practices are developed and experimented by GalliGalli  using technologies to promote government transparency and attract civic participation through crowdsourcing on different topics which aims to bridge citizen-state gap into daily governance. </p><p>This paper will focus on ‘Nalibeli’ platform developed in Kathmandu to support state-citizens interaction as service providers-and-receivers. For example, when people want to start a business or non-profit, they have to register at the concerned government offices. Subsequently, there are periodic obligations such as submitting annual reports, filing tax returns, and calling general meeting. ‘Nalibeli’ plays a role of consultant to equip people with all the necessary information to fulfill these obligations. Not only through online open technology, a group of young volunteers also visit the concerned offices and guide people through each of the steps if they require support. ‘Nalibeli’ also perform Service Delivery Mapping which is an on-the-ground survey, research, and mapping initiative to document the nature of day-to-day problems faced by citizens, creating a listing of service providers by locality, understand the manner in which neighbourhoods organize. Most of these information are made available through an open platform (<a href='www.nalibeli.org'>www.nalibeli.org</a>) with step-by-step information on how to access a range of government services.  The platform runs on information shared by thousands of individual users. The usefulness of the platform increases as the number of active users grow. The platform has information in Nepali and English. This paper aims to unpack these complex realities of running open source approach to facilitate state-citizens relationship focusing on the ‘Nalibeli’ platform developed by GalliGalli initiative.</p>"

How can we extend civic tech to civic organizations outside community?</p><p>In South Korea. most of civic organizations(NPO, NGO, and the media) are interested in data and data journalism, but they don’t have capacity to treat the data and data journalism. Event they don’t have any developers to maintain their own website. Because of that, after they constructed huge and valuable data to make stories for years, the data has been hidden somewhere on their PCs in not-machine-readable formats.</p><p>From this year, we’re developing a Data Specialists Working Group composed of civic hackers; technitians, designers, and data experts. This group will be in partnerships with NPO, NGO, and the media for data journalism projects. CodeNamu civic technitians and our partners composed of journalists and activits will make synergy to make those data open and to make various data journalism projects between CodeNamu’s civic tech and partners’ insight or messages.

How new technologies are moving us closer to participation? Did new applications can connect (or disconnect) citizens? Is it possible to empower citizens and allow them to manage our cities (not only from time to time, but daily)?

I'm going to share a story about a much longer game, where the payoff is just starting to happen now, five years later.</p><p>This will be a story of how organizations around the world built a software stack for legislative monitoring. It starts with a vision shared in Warsaw in 2011. In 2012, work on a standard data interchange format begins, which will tie the stack together. Two organizations start authoring backend data management tools in 2013 using this format. In 2014, the first user-facing tools appear at the top of this stack. And in 2015, governments begin adopting the data standard, as more user-facing tools spread.</p><p>This journey will visit many organizations and projects around the world, from mySociety to OpenAustralia to Sunlight, and from PopIt to Councilmatic to Represent, among others. We're five years into this journey, and there's still more ground to cover for at least as many more years before the basic problems in legislative monitoring that we're solving can be taken for granted.</p><p>This talk ties into the fork-merge theme. Legislative monitoring generally involves forking the official website, which requires scraping data to reproduce the information. Through government adoption of data standards like Popolo, we can eliminate these scrapers, and merge good data publication practices into government.</p>"

            "abstract": "<p>From the point of view of urban governance, Nepal’s towns and cities have expanded rapidly. The Kathmandu Valley has grown especially rapidly – from a population of about 1.6 million in 2001 to a population of about 2.5 million in 2011. This unexpected and unplanned growth has proven a challenge to many aspects of city life. The systems by which residents communicate, organize themselves, and negotiate with each other and the state has altered. When the intention is to radically reform the system, large amounts of money and manpower must be gathered. At the same time, there are few initiatives as well who take the opposite approach. New belief is that limited resources and focus also be sufficient in order to begin to dent the system as much as possible on basis of collaborations and crowdsourcing even though there are no single and known solutions to the complex issues of urban governance and no guarantee that any given intervention will succeed.</p><p>GalliGalli is an initiative based in Kathmandu which gathers, packages, and disseminates information using new technologies for the civilians to make their lives easier by providing information on processes – formal and informal – for accessing government services. GalliGalli works both on-the-ground and online. GalliGalli’s core focus is to use open source approach to enable people to take part in social change by facilitating mass participation. This paper would like to explain how these processes and practices are developed and experimented by GalliGalli  using technologies to promote government transparency and attract civic participation through crowdsourcing on different topics which aims to bridge citizen-state gap into daily governance. </p><p>This paper will focus on ‘Nalibeli’ platform developed in Kathmandu to support state-citizens interaction as service providers-and-receivers. For example, when people want to start a business or non-profit, they have to register at the concerned government offices. Subsequently, there are periodic obligations such as submitting annual reports, filing tax returns, and calling general meeting. ‘Nalibeli’ plays a role of consultant to equip people with all the necessary information to fulfill these obligations. Not only through online open technology, a group of young volunteers also visit the concerned offices and guide people through each of the steps if they require support. ‘Nalibeli’ also perform Service Delivery Mapping which is an on-the-ground survey, research, and mapping initiative to document the nature of day-to-day problems faced by citizens, creating a listing of service providers by locality, understand the manner in which neighbourhoods organize. Most of these information are made available through an open platform (<a href='www.nalibeli.org'>www.nalibeli.org</a>) with step-by-step information on how to access a range of government services.  The platform runs on information shared by thousands of individual users. The usefulness of the platform increases as the number of active users grow. The platform has information in Nepali and English. This paper aims to unpack these complex realities of running open source approach to facilitate state-citizens relationship focusing on the ‘Nalibeli’ platform developed by GalliGalli initiative.</p>"
